### 🔍 Newrelic Integration (Optional)

The Google Analytics Extension (GA4) comes pre-configured for integration with New Relic, allowing you to monitor your application's performance in real-time. This feature provides insights to help you improve and optimize your extension efficiently.

To leverage New Relic for performance monitoring, update the default values for the following environment variables in the app/fdk/config.js file in your project directory. This step ensures the New Relic integration is securely configured with your specific credentials.

1. `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`: Set this to the name you wish your application to appear as in New Relic. It helps easily identify your project within the New Relic dashboard.
2. `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: This is your unique New Relic license key, which authorizes the New Relic agent to send monitoring data to your New Relic account.

    ```javascript
      newrelic: {
        app_name: {
          doc: 'new relic app name',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME',
          arg: 'new_relic_app_name',
        },
        license_key: {
          doc: 'new relic license key',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',
          args: 'new_relic_license_key',
        },
      },
    ```

By updating these variables, you can activate New Relic's data collection, offering a comprehensive view of your application's performance.

> **Notes :**
To remove New Relic integration completely, delete the New Relic environment variables in your `app/fdk/config.js` file and uninstall the New Relic package with `npm uninstall newrelic`. Remove `require('./connections/newrelic');` from `app/index.js`. Delete the `app/connections/newrelic.js` and `newrelic.js` files and update your documentation accordingly.

### 🚨 Sentry Integration (Optional)

Similar to New Relic, the Google Analytics Extension (GA4) comes pre-configured for optional integration with Sentry. Sentry provides real-time error tracking and monitoring, offering insights to quickly identify, diagnose, and fix issues, thereby enhancing your extension's reliability and user experience.

To enable Sentry for error monitoring, update the environment variables in the `app/fdk/config.js` file with your Sentry credentials:

1. `SENTRY_DSN`: This is the unique Data Source Name (DSN) provided by Sentry, which directs error messages to your Sentry project.
2. `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`: Specify the environment your application is running in, such as development, staging, or production. This helps in filtering and categorizing issues within Sentry.

    ```javascript
      sentry: {
        dsn: {
          doc: 'sentry url',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'SENTRY_DSN',
          arg: 'sentry_dsn',
        },
        environment: {
          doc: 'sentry environment',
          format: String,
          default: 'development',
          env: 'SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT',
          arg: 'sentry_environment',
        },
      },
    ```

Configuring these variables enables Sentry's error tracking for your application, offering a layer of insight into its stability and helping you maintain a high-quality user experience.

> **Notes :**
To remove Sentry integration, delete the Sentry environment variables in your `app/fdk/config.js` file and uninstall the Sentry package with `npm uninstall @sentry/node`. Remove `require('./connections/sentry');` from `app/index.js`. Delete the `app/connections/sentry.js` and `sentry.js` files and update your documentation accordingly.

## ✅ Health Check Endpoints and Container Orchestration

Our application offers several endpoints designed to monitor its health and readiness, particularly beneficial in containerized environments such as Docker or Kubernetes:

- `/_livez`: This endpoint verifies the liveness of the application, indicating whether it is running.
- `/_healthz`: It assesses the overall health of the application, including critical components like database connections.
- `/_readyz`: This endpoint confirms if the application is prepared to handle requests by checking if all initializations have successfully completed.

These endpoints provide a JSON response with an "ok" status, indicating the health status. A response of { "ok": true } signifies the application is healthy and ready, while { "ok": false } indicates an issue. This functionality ensures Kubernetes actively monitors the application's health and readiness, enhancing reliability and uptime.
