          default: 'Your API Secret',
          env: 'EXTENSION_API_SECRET',
        },
      },
    ```

8. 🖥️ Also update MongoDB and Redis Environment Variables according to your machine.

9. **🔒 Secure Tunnel Setup.**

   Install ngrok or a similar cross-platform application to create secure tunnels, enabling your locally hosted web server to be accessible over the internet.

<p align="center">
  <a target="_blank" href="https://ngrok.com/download">
    <img src="https://cdn.pixelbin.io/v2/broken-limit-7ed062/original/ngrok-logo.png" alt="Ngrok" />
  </a>
</p>

10. 🚀 Launch ngrok to forward the port used by your local server.

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
    Replace `3000` with the actual port number your server is using. This will generate a public URL that securely tunnels to your local server.

11. 🌐 Update default env value for `GA4_MAIN_DOMAIN` with this URL in `BROWSER_CONFIG.HOST_MAIN_URL`.

    ```javascript
    BROWSER_CONFIG: {
        HOST_MAIN_URL: {
          doc: 'Host Main URL',
          format: String,
          default: 'https://your-ngrok-url',
          env: 'GA4_MAIN_DOMAIN',
          arg: 'ga4_main_domain',
        },
      },
    ```

12. 🛠️ Navigate to your extension in the Partner Panel and update the Extension URL field with the generated ngrok URL.

13. **💻 Run local server.**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

14. 🎉 You are ready to go.

### 🧪 Running Test Cases

After you have completed the local setup, you can run the test cases to ensure everything is working as expected. Follow these steps to execute the tests:

1. **📁 Navigate to the Project Directory.**

   If you're not already there, switch to your project's root directory in your terminal.

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. **🧪 Run Backend Tests.**

   Execute the backend test cases using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

3. **📁 Navigate to the Frontend Directory.**

   From the root of your project, move into the web directory.

    ```bash
    cd web
    ```

4. **🧪 Run Frontend Tests.**

   Execute the Frontend test cases using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

Running both sets of tests ensures a comprehensive check of both the frontend and backend of your extension. We aim for over 90% test coverage to maintain a robust and reliable codebase.

### 🔍 Newrelic Integration (Optional)

The Google Analytics Extension (GA4) comes pre-configured for integration with New Relic, allowing you to monitor your application's performance in real-time. This feature provides insights to help you improve and optimize your extension efficiently.

To leverage New Relic for performance monitoring, update the default values for the following environment variables in the app/fdk/config.js file in your project directory. This step ensures the New Relic integration is securely configured with your specific credentials.

1. `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`: Set this to the name you wish your application to appear as in New Relic. It helps easily identify your project within the New Relic dashboard.
2. `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: This is your unique New Relic license key, which authorizes the New Relic agent to send monitoring data to your New Relic account.

    ```javascript
      newrelic: {
        app_name: {
          doc: 'new relic app name',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME',
          arg: 'new_relic_app_name',
        },
        license_key: {
          doc: 'new relic license key',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY',
          args: 'new_relic_license_key',
        },
      },
    ```

By updating these variables, you can activate New Relic's data collection, offering a comprehensive view of your application's performance.

> **Notes :**
To remove New Relic integration completely, delete the New Relic environment variables in your `app/fdk/config.js` file and uninstall the New Relic package with `npm uninstall newrelic`. Remove `require('./connections/newrelic');` from `app/index.js`. Delete the `app/connections/newrelic.js` and `newrelic.js` files and update your documentation accordingly.

### 🚨 Sentry Integration (Optional)

Similar to New Relic, the Google Analytics Extension (GA4) comes pre-configured for optional integration with Sentry. Sentry provides real-time error tracking and monitoring, offering insights to quickly identify, diagnose, and fix issues, thereby enhancing your extension's reliability and user experience.

To enable Sentry for error monitoring, update the environment variables in the `app/fdk/config.js` file with your Sentry credentials:

1. `SENTRY_DSN`: This is the unique Data Source Name (DSN) provided by Sentry, which directs error messages to your Sentry project.
2. `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`: Specify the environment your application is running in, such as development, staging, or production. This helps in filtering and categorizing issues within Sentry.

    ```javascript
      sentry: {
        dsn: {
          doc: 'sentry url',
          format: String,
          default: '',
          env: 'SENTRY_DSN',
          arg: 'sentry_dsn',
        },
        environment: {
          doc: 'sentry environment',
          format: String,
          default: 'development',
          env: 'SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT',
          arg: 'sentry_environment',
        },
      },
    ```

Configuring these variables enables Sentry's error tracking for your application, offering a layer of insight into its stability and helping you maintain a high-quality user experience.

> **Notes :**
To remove Sentry integration, delete the Sentry environment variables in your `app/fdk/config.js` file and uninstall the Sentry package with `npm uninstall @sentry/node`. Remove `require('./connections/sentry');` from `app/index.js`. Delete the `app/connections/sentry.js` and `sentry.js` files and update your documentation accordingly.

## ✅ Health Check Endpoints and Container Orchestration

Our application offers several endpoints designed to monitor its health and readiness, particularly beneficial in containerized environments such as Docker or Kubernetes:

- `/_livez`: This endpoint verifies the liveness of the application, indicating whether it is running.
- `/_healthz`: It assesses the overall health of the application, including critical components like database connections.
- `/_readyz`: This endpoint confirms if the application is prepared to handle requests by checking if all initializations have successfully completed.

These endpoints provide a JSON response with an "ok" status, indicating the health status. A response of { "ok": true } signifies the application is healthy and ready, while { "ok": false } indicates an issue. This functionality ensures Kubernetes actively monitors the application's health and readiness, enhancing reliability and uptime.
